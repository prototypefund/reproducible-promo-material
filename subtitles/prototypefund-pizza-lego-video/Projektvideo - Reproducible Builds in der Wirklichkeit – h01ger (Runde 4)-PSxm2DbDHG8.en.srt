00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
I'm Holger Levsen

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,700
and since 5 years I've been working on Reproducible Builds

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,100
where we aim to create a more secure delivery chain for software productions.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
Our aim is, that one can be sure

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,400
that the tools built

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,300
don't contain any backdoors, that they all do the same.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
In the past

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,900
'reproducible' or 'reproducible programs' ment

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
'I built a program twice

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,800
und I twice get a program which does the same things.'

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
For us, it means 'bit by bit identical'

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,000
as in I build a program twice

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
and as a result I have twice an identical pile of bits,

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,900
which is 100% the same.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,800
I've got two pizzas here, made by machines,

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
but they are different because

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the ingredients, food, simply is organic, thus different.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,100
While these two bags of lego

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,200
let you build two times a 100% identical result.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
This lego is not fully identical...

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,500
the proof has been made

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not a machine.
